              <h2>Ambition</h2>
              <h3 class="quote">"There is something magical about the spark between friends when in the tense moments of decision making, playful tactics and winning or losing a bet together in the real world - and our ambition was to capture that excitement online."

               <div class="line"></div>
              <h2>Headlines</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Following a lean, agile design methodology, Group Bets is proving to be one of the biggest innovations to the online gambling industry in years.</li>
                <li>For the first time online, Group bets allows groups of friends to build an accumulator together. This transforms an observed tedious offline behaviour into the slick digital world.</li>
                <li>I acted as Lead UX for Group Bets from contextual enquiries in Discovery through to post launch Beta phase analysis and further iteration; earning an internal recognition award for exemplary working practices along the way.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="line"></div>
               <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
              <h3>Would this idea <span class="highlight">really</span> solve a probem?</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3>During the early days, we didn’t have a clear direction where this idea could take us.
So far this was only an idea from a few user testing participants who were comfortable enough to indulge us with their anecdotes of how they felt winning and losing a bet in a group.</h3> <h3> This could be a new to industry product, there were no direct competitors to compare or analyse, this was all sentiment.</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3 class="center">We needed to know more.</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
             <h3>I partnered with both the UX and Research team to broaden the breadth of our user understanding at this very early stage.</h3>
               <div class="line"></div>
               <h2>Method</h2>
              <h3>Contextual session in our Usability Suite</h3>

              <h3>I invited ‘chairpersons’ who had previously mentioned their group betting behaviour to come to our lab in the office. I asked them to bring their friends to watch a football match - a context trying to match their natural behaviour as much as possible.</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h2>Early Insights</h2>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <ol>
                  <li>This is a <span class="bold">real</span> natural behaviour</li>
                  <li>There is currently <span class="bold">no way</span>, simple or otherwise, to do this online</li>
                  <li>There is a very real <span class="bold">human</span> element behind this</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
              <h3>Is there a business case for Group Bets?</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3>I partnered with Sky Bet’s <span class="bold">Principal Product Manager</span>. Before jumping right into it, we knew it would be important to define what a successful product could achieve, or what we would even define as a successful product. 

Taking on board all previous research, on-site analytics and data models of current betting behaviour, with the product manager taking the lead, we concluded on some early, assumptive, key performance indicators.</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>The bookmaker market is highly innovation led, with competitors quick to catch up. Data shows users are loyal to a brand who is seen to be leading the market</li>
                  <li>Quantitative research I comissioned showed 29% of the betting market carry out this behaviour which was claimed to be in addition to their regular betting. Of this 29%, frequent group bettors (defined as once a week) make up 26%, with the rest being occasional group bettors (once a month). </li>
                  <li>We knew from early research there was momentum behind the idea, so we proposed this product could, if done well, be a significant differentiator, something needed to achieve Sky Bet's aim of being the UK’s number 1 bookmaker.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="line"></div>
                <h3 class="center">We got the green light to go ahead.</h3>

              <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
              <h3>We can design a product which can satisfy our user’s needs.</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3>This is where I met my partner for this project, Senior UI Designer - Steve Robertson.</h3>
              <h3>We had a challenge on our hands.</h3>
              <h3>We had sentiment, pain points, quantitative research, stakeholder buy-in, user observations, what ‘happy/unhappy’ outputs could be, but no firm idea on how the product could work, yet.</h3>

              <h3>From talking to users we knew the product must:</h3>

                  <li>Facilitate a group of friends to build an accumulator together</li>
                  <li>Keep hold of the sense of friendship and togetherness</li>

               <h3>From experience we knew the product must:</h3>
              <ol>

                  <li>Be focused on satisfying the needs of our users</li>
                  <li>Ultimately be simple to use</li>

              <h3>User Flow Brainstorming following Double Diamond</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3>It was time to put pen to paper and create some early user flows. I led these sessions and ensured to follow a double diamond thinking process. </h3>
              <h3 class="converge">Diverge = <span class="bold"> Create Choices </span> → </h3>
              <h3 class="converge">Converge = <span class="bold">Make Choices</span></h3>
          
              <h3>For every design problem, we empathised in detail the problem was we were trying to solve, bringing it back to the user every time. If there was no clear way forward, we would allocate some time to spend creative energy on solving the problem, creating choices. <br><br>

Upon converging we were open and constructively critical of each solution. Constantly iterating and taking the best ideas forward.<br><br>

We were able to define some user flows using the above method. We used cards so we could easily swap and change during discussions, continually iterating for the best possible output.</h3>

              <h3>Talk about group betting was beginning to build in the office. Recognising an opportunity for stakeholder buy-in, I organised an ideation workshop. <br><br>

Gathering a multidisciplinary team, I wanted to propose the design challenge to a team of experienced experts. My session plan can be seen in the image above. It involved capturing the teams ideas on their own or in small groups, presenting their ideas back and iterating until we have a consensus in the room of what we assumed were good ideas. Output is to the right.

               <h2>Method</h2>
              <h3>Learn, Build Measure</h3>
              <div class="line"></div>
              <h3>It was time to build the first prototype for usability testing. <br><br>

We knew regular communication with users was the only way to build a successful product. We followed a lean Learn, Build, Measure cycle - this meant iteration, iteration, iteration. Each iteration we learned new things, constantly improving the user experience - failing and learning fast. <br><br>

I built into the design process five, hour long lab based usability sessions - held every two weeks. This, as with any user-centered design process, was invaluable. It gave us the opportunity to gain regular, treasured customer insights.  <br><br>

Building on the already established customer research we sketched out each user flow on a whiteboard and started to build basic interfaces.  <br><br>

After each design milestone such as a new proposed solution, we used it as an opportunity to collaborate and so held friendly discussions with stakeholders about the merits and drawbacks of each solution.</h3>

         <h3>As two of the core concepts to emerge from my research were group accumulator collaboration and ‘tipster leagues’ we made an assumption to separate these two on a hierarchical level. <br><br>

Above are some of my early mock-ups, due to the simplicity of the style guide it was easy enough to create these in Sketch. This meant we could provide prototypes that look very similar to the real thing to get the best possible feedback.<br><br>

Concepts such as joining a group, having a chairperson, chat, feed and points are still in the product today.
